# Proxmox Script Guardian

Proxmox Script Guardian is an open-source tool that audits Proxmox helper scripts for potential security and safety issues.  
It scans Bash scripts for dangerous or risky patterns and produces a plain-language report.

This is a prototype/learning project that will evolve into a larger system for automated scanning, attestation, and verification.
